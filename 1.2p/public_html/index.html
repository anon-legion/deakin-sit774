    <br />
    <!-- origin of TCP/IP -->
    <h2>
      <u>Origin</u>
      <br />
      TCP is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It
      originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented
      the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly
      referred to as TCP/IP
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is a
      <b>
        <i>
          framework for organizing the communication protocols used in the
          Internet
        </i>
      </b>
      and similar computer networks according to functional criteria. The
      foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol
      (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Internet Protocol (IP).
      Early versions of this networking model were known as the Department of
      Defense (DoD) model because the research and development were funded by
      the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.

    <!-- main uses of TCP/IP -->
    <h2>
      <u>Use</u>
      <br />
      Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote
      administration, and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the
      transport layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      TCP is used extensively by many internet applications, including the
      <i>
        World Wide Web (WWW), email, File Transfer Protocol, Secure Shell,
        peer-to-peer file sharing, and streaming media.
      </i>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      TCP is
      <b> optimized for accurate delivery rather than timely delivery </b> and
      can incur relatively long delays (on the order of seconds) while waiting
      for out-of-order messages or re-transmissions of lost messages. Therefore,
      it is <u> not particularly suitable for real-time applications </u> such
      as voice over IP. For such applications, protocols like the Real-time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) operating over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
      are usually recommended instead.
    </blockquote>
    <!-- functionalities of TCP/IP -->
    <h2>
      <u>Functionalities</u>
      <br />
      TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of
      octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an
      IP network.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Reliable transmission</strong>
      <br />
      TCP uses a sequence number to identify each byte of data. The sequence
      number identifies the order of the bytes sent from each computer so that
      <i>
        <u>
          the data can be reconstructed in order, regardless of any out-of-order
          delivery that may occur.
        </u>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Error detection</strong>
      <br />
      Sequence numbers allow receivers to discard duplicate packets and properly
      sequence out-of-order packets. Acknowledgments allow senders to determine
      when to retransmit lost packets. To assure correctness a checksum field is
      included;
